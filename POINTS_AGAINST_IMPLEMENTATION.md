# Points Against Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines the steps to implement `points_against` data in the ESPN Dashboard project. The issue was that the database schema and migration scripts were missing the `points_against` field, even though the original dashboard had this data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Update
- **File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- **Change**: Added `points_against Float` field to the Team model
- **Migration**: Created migration file to add the column to existing databases

### 2. Migration Script Fix
- **File**: `scripts/migrate-data.ts`
- **Change**: Removed the code that was explicitly excluding `points_against` from team data
- **Impact**: Now includes `points_against` when migrating from SQLite to PostgreSQL

### 3. API Route Updates
- **File**: `src/app/api/league/[year]/route.ts`
- **Change**: Updated standings to use actual `points_against` instead of hardcoded 0
- **File**: `src/app/api/teams/history/[team_id]/route.ts`
- **Change**: Updated team history to use actual `points_against` data

### 4. Data Population Scripts
- **File**: `scripts/populate-points-against.ts`
- **Purpose**: Populate existing teams with `points_against` data from SQLite database
- **File**: `scripts/fetch-current-data.ts`
- **Purpose**: Fetch fresh data from ESPN API for current seasons

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
```bash
cd espn-dashboard
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_points_against
```

### Step 2: Re-export Data from Original Dashboard
The original dashboard database contains the `points_against` data. Run the migration script:
```bash
node migrate-with-points-against.js
```

### Step 3: Fetch Current Season Data (Optional)
To get fresh data from ESPN API for current seasons:
```bash
# Set environment variables first
export ESPN_LEAGUE_ID="your_league_id"
export ESPN_S2="your_espn_s2_token"
export ESPN_SWID="your_swid_token"

npm run ts-node scripts/fetch-current-data.ts
```

### Step 4: Verify Implementation
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the dashboard
3. Check that standings now show actual `points_against` values
4. Verify team history pages show correct `points_vs` data

## Environment Variables Required
For fetching fresh data from ESPN API:
- `ESPN_LEAGUE_ID`: Your ESPN fantasy league ID
- `ESPN_S2`: Your ESPN S2 authentication token
- `ESPN_SWID`: Your ESPN SWID authentication token

## Data Sources
- **Historical Data**: Migrated from original dashboard SQLite database with points_against
- **Current Data**: Fetched directly from ESPN API
- **Points Against**: Available in original dashboard database and ESPN API as `team.points_against`

## Verification
After implementation, you should see:
- ✅ Points Against column in standings table
- ✅ Actual values instead of 0s
- ✅ Team history pages showing correct points against averages
- ✅ No more hardcoded 0 values in API responses

## Troubleshooting
1. **Migration fails**: Ensure database is accessible and you have proper permissions
2. **Script errors**: Check that all environment variables are set correctly
3. **API errors**: Verify ESPN API credentials are valid and current
4. **Data not showing**: Clear browser cache and restart development server

## Notes
- The ESPN API provides `points_against` data for all teams
- Historical data from SQLite database should include `points_against` values
- New data fetched from ESPN API will automatically include `points_against`
- The implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing data
